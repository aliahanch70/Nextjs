# Real-Time Cart Updates Across All Pages

This document explains how real-time cart updates are implemented across all pages in our application.

## Implementation Overview

1. **CartContext (context/CartContext.tsx)**
   - Provides a global state for the cart using React Context.
   - Offers functions to add and remove items from the cart.
   - Uses localStorage to persist cart data between page reloads.

2. **CartProvider (context/CartContext.tsx)**
   - Wraps the entire application to provide cart state and functions to all components.

3. **Providers (app/providers.tsx)**
   - Wraps the entire application with necessary providers, including the CartProvider.

4. **Navbar (components/Navbar.tsx)**
   - Uses the useCart hook to access cart state.
   - Displays the current number of items in the cart.
   - Updates in real-time when cart items change.

5. **Cart Page (app/cart/page.tsx)**
   - Uses the useCart hook to access and display cart items.
   - Allows users to remove items from the cart.
   - Updates in real-time when cart items change.

6. **Product Page (app/product/[name]/page.tsx)**
   - Uses the useCart hook to add items to the cart.
   - Updates the cart in real-time when a product is added.
   - Displays a success message when an item is added to the cart.

## How It Works

1. When a user adds or removes an item from the cart, the CartContext updates its state and localStorage.
2. The Navbar component, which uses the cart state, automatically re-renders to reflect the updated cart count.
3. If the user is on the cart page, it also re-renders to show the updated list of items.
4. As the CartProvider wraps the entire application, any component can access the cart state and will update in real-time when changes occur.

This implementation ensures that cart updates are reflected immediately across all pages without the need for manual refreshes or additional state management. Whether a user adds an item to the cart from the product page, removes an item on the cart page, or views the cart count in the navbar, all components will stay in sync with the latest cart state.
